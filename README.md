# Game example

## Online game created using play framework and scalajs

This project is in progress, but it is possible to try it. After cloning or downloading repository just use 'sbt run' command to start the game server.
It should be now available under localhost:9000.

For now there are only available games versus AI with limitted units and functionalities, more will be added in the future.
Code needs a lot of refactor, beacuase i was learning technology, designing functionalities and developing at the same time.
Still i think it show the power of full-stack scala providing time safety and realiable IDE support for style-sheets, scripts etc.
